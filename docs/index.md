## Project Overview

Fire-Prox is a schemaless, state-aware proxy library for Google Cloud Firestore designed to accelerate rapid prototyping. Unlike traditional Object-Document Mappers (ODMs), Fire-Prox embraces dynamic, schema-free development by providing an intuitive, Pythonic interface that reduces boilerplate and aligns with object-oriented programming patterns.

**Key Philosophy**: Fire-Prox is an "anti-ODM" for the prototyping stage, wrapping (not replacing) the official `google-cloud-firestore` library to provide a higher-level abstraction optimized for developer velocity during rapid iteration.
